#Project Overview: 
This project demonstrates and end-to-end UI test automation framework for testing the Open Cart e-commerce application. The framework is implemented using Selenium 4.x, Java, & TestNG. It is designed for
robust and scalable automated testing of web applications.

#Features:

*Page Object Model (POM): Clean separation of test scripts and page objects for better maintainability.

*Custom WebDriver Event Listeners: Enhanced logging and reporting of browser interactions.

*Dynamic Wait Strategies: Efficient use of explicit and fluent waits to handle dynamic elements.

*Data-Driven Testing: Utilizes CSV data providers for test parameterization.

*Parallel Execution: Leverages TestNG for executing tests in parallel to reduce execution time.

*Cross-Browser Testing: Supports testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.

*Detailed Reporting: Generates test execution reports using ExtentReports and Allure Reports.

*Custom Exception Handling: Retry mechanisms for flaky tests and enhanced failure management.

*Screenshots on Failures: Captures screenshots automatically for failed tests.

*Reusable Components: Includes libraries for common UI elements and actions.

*Integration with CI/CD: Configured for Jenkins to enable continuous testing.
